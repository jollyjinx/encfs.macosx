encFS with osxfuse
==================

1.7.4 Version of encfs (http://www.arg0.net/encfs) has problems with links on Mac OS X. This is a script to get a working version of encfs on Mavericks. Checkout git version 36d6c6cbd for a version that works on Mountain Lion.

It uses Homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) and osxfuse (http://osxfuse.github.com).

Installing with Homebrew
------------------------

    brew update              && \
    brew tap jollyjinx/encfs && \
    brew install jollyjinx/encfs/encfs

Be sure to follow the instructions in the caveats for osxfuse, similar to:

> The new osxfuse file system bundle needs to be installed by the root user:
>
>     sudo /bin/cp -RfX /usr/local/Cellar/osxfuse/2.6.2/Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs /Library/Filesystems
>     sudo chmod +s /Library/Filesystems/osxfusefs.fs/Support/load_osxfusefs

After that you should have a working encfs in /usr/local/bin/.

Example
-------

If you want to use it for your Dropbox Documents directory you could use it like this:

    encfs ~/Dropbox/Documents.encfs ~/Dropbox/Documents.secure -- -o volname="Documents"
